# MVP.pm
Perl package that determines the majority feature values of the nodes of a phylogenetic tree by simple majority rule and parsimony.
The pacakage requires a Newick tree as input. The node identifiers of the Newick tree should contain values in @-delimited fields. The values at a particular field represent a feature of that tree. The node identifiers have to be specifically formatted as accession_number@date@feature1@feature2@feature3..., in which the accession number and date are mandatory, and follows with an arbitrary number of optional features. The feature fields can be accessed by an integer starting with zero. For a node identifier with N fields, the first feature is 0, and second is 1, and the last is N - 1. Therefore 0 represents accession number, 1 represents date, and so on.
